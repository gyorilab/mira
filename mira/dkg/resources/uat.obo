name: Accretion
def: "The process by which an object increases its mass under the influence of its gravitational attraction. Accretion plays a key role in a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. In particular stars result from the accretion of material by a protostar from a surrounding molecular cloud. The accumulation of mass on the protostar involves the formation of an accretion disk. Theoretical and observational investigations of protostars and newborn stars indicate the important role of magnetic fields in this process. They favor the magnetospheric accretion model for mass transfer from the circumstellar disk onto the newborn star. In this model\, the stellar magnetosphere truncates the disk at a few stellar radii. Gas from the disk accretes onto the star along the magnetic field lines and hits the stellar surface at approximately the free fall velocity\, causing a strong accretion shock. Various emission lines are formed in the infalling magnetospheric flow. Moreover\, optical/ultraviolet excess continuum emission is produced in the accretion shocks. The accretion is accompanied by mass ejection through collimated bipolar jets." []

If a large number of pulsation modes occurs\, then the stellar interior\, which is not directly observable\, can be probed from oscillation studies because the modes penetrate to various depths inside the star. Using a complex mathematical analysis\, very detailed investigations of the structure of the star's interior can be carried out. Applied to the Sun\, it is called helioseismology." []

The other mirror\, the index mirror\, moves with an index arm pivoted at the center of the arc. The index arm is equipped with a vernier which moves along the limb. An object in direction S can be observed in the telescope through the un-silvered portion of the horizon glass. By moving the index arm\, the second object S' is made to coincide with S in the telescope. According to the law of reflection\, the angle between S and S' is double the angle between the mirrors. The angular distance between the objects can therefore be obtained from the measurement of angles between the planes of the mirrors." []

At the time of the Big Bang\, and for about 380\,000 years afterwards\, Universe was ionized and photons and baryons were tightly coupled. Acoustic oscillations arose from perturbations in the primordial plasma due to the competition between gravitational attraction and gas+photons pressure. After the epoch of recombination\, these oscillations froze and imprinted their signatures in both the CMB and matter distribution. In the case of the photons\, the acoustic mode history is manifested as the high-contrast Doppler peaks in the temperature anisotropies. As for baryons\, they were in a similar state\, and when mixed with the non-oscillating cold dark matter perturbations\, they left a small residual imprint in the clustering of matter on very large scales\, ~100 h^-1 Mpc \(h being the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s^-1 Mpc^-1\). The phenomenon of BAOs\, recently discovered using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data\, is a confirmation of the current model of cosmology. Like Type Ia supernovae\, BAOs provide a standard candle for determining cosmic distances.

It is seen to be composed of a head and often with a spectacular gaseous tail extending a great distance from the head. The rocky-icy head is called the comet nucleus. As the comet nears the Sun\, the increased temperature causes the ice in the nucleus to sublimate and form a gaseous halo around the nucleus\, called the coma. Comets often possess two tails\, a dust tail that lies in the orbit behind the comet generated by surface activity\, and a brighter\, ionized gas tail\, that points away from the Sun\, driven by solar wind. Cometary reservoirs are thought to represent primordial solar system material. A comet with a dust coating on its surface that inhibits gas production might be classified as an asteroid. Because of this ambiguity\, objects such as Chiron\, Centaur asteroid\, have been reclassified as comets. Comets are primarily composed of amorphous water ice\, but also contain carbon dioxide\, carbon monoxide\, formaldehyde\, methanol\, methane at a few percent level \(with respect to water\)\, and many other molecules at a lower level."

When these ejections reach the Earth\, they give rise to geomagnetic storms.

Where gravity pulls things together at the more local level\, dark energy tears them apart on the grander scale. The acceleration equation\, one of Einstein's equations for the homogeneous Universe\, indicates that if the Universe is accelerating\, the pressure of the driving component should be strongly negative.  The first indication of dark energy was provided by the observation of Type Ia supernovae. Other probes of dark energy are\: baryon acoustic oscillations\, weak gravitational lensing\, and clusters of galaxies. In the standard model of cosmology\, dark energy currently accounts for almost 74% of the total mass-energy of the Universe.

Nearby galaxy clusters such as the Virgo\, Fornax\, Centaurus\, and Coma clusters contain hundreds to thousands of individual dSph galaxies. These galaxies have very low surface brightnesses\, as low as only 1% that of the sky background. They are also among the smallest\, least luminous galaxies known. Most of the radiation from dSph galaxies is emitted by stars in the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The lack of strong emission lines\, infrared\, or radio emission suggests that these galaxies are generally devoid of interstellar medium. The velocities of stars within dSph galaxies are so high that them must be disrupting. However\, the bulk of mass in these galaxies might be undetected. Dynamical models that include dark matter do adequately explain the velocity dispersion of the stars in all dSph systems. In the most extreme cases\, only 1% of the mass of the galaxy is visible.

def: "The theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein \(1916\) that describes the gravitation as the space-time curvature caused by the presence of matter or energy. Mass creates a gravitational field which distorts the space and changes the flow of time. In other words\, mass causes a deviation of the metric of space-time continuum from that of the 'flat' space-time structure described by the Euclidean geometry and treated in special relativity. General relativity developed from the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial forces. According to general relativity\, photons follow a curved path in a gravitational field. This prediction was confirmed by the measurements of star positions near the solar limb during the total eclipse of 1919. The same effect is seen in the delay of radio signals coming from distant space probes when grazing the Sun's surface. Moreover\, the space curvature caused by the Sun makes the perihelion of Mercury's orbit advance by 43'' per century more than that predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. The perihelion advance can reach several degrees per year for binary pulsar orbits. Another effect predicted by general relativity is the gravitational reddening. This effect is verified in the redshift of spectral lines in the solar spectrum and\, even more obviously\, in white dwarfs. Other predictions of the theory include gravitational lensing\, gravitational waves\, and the invariance of Newton's gravitational constant." []

Globular clusters are gravitationally bound systems\, highly concentrated to the center \(up to a few 10^3 stars per cubic light-years\)\, with a volume ranging from a few dozen up to more than 300 light-years in diameter. They are generally old and metal-poor and are among the first objects to be formed in a galaxy. There is also strong evidence that they form in major galaxy interactions and mergers. The stars in a globular cluster are thought to have a common origin and thus a single age and chemical abundance; with some exceptions such as Omega Centauri and NGC 2808\, which exhibit multiple populations. The presence of various sub-populations within a globular cluster is interpreted as indicating distinct epochs of mass accretion and/or major star formation. The Milky Way hosts about 200 globular clusters. They are spherically distributed about the Galactic Center up to a radius of 350 light-years\, with a maximum concentration toward the Galactic center. All but the smallest dwarf galaxies possess globular clusters. Some galaxies\, e.g. M87\, contain several thousands of them. There are\, however\, important differences. While all the globular clusters in our Galaxy and in M31 are old \(ages of about 10 billion years\, at least\)\, there are galaxies\, such as the two Magellanic Clouds and M33\, that host much younger globular clusters \(ages of a few billion years\, or less\)."

def: "The darkening\, or brightening\, of a region on a star due to localized decrease\, or increase\, in the effective gravity. Gravity darkening is explained by the von Zeipel theorem\, whereby on stellar surface the radiative flux is proportional to the effective gravity. This means that in rotating stars regions close to the pole are brighter \(and have higher temperature\) than regions close to the equator. Gravity darkening occurs also in corotating binary systems\, where the tidal force leads to both gravity darkening and gravity brightening. The effects are often seen in binary star light curves. Recent theoretical work has shown that gravity darkening is not well represented by the von Zeipel theorem. This is supported by new interferometric observations of some rapidly rotating stars indicating that the von Zeipel theorem seems to overestimate the temperature difference between the poles and equator."

The lower edge of this strip\, known as the zero age main sequence \(ZAMS\)\, designates the positions where stars of different mass first begin to burn hydrogen in their cores. Well below the main sequence there is a group of stars that\, despite being very hot\, are so small that their luminosity is very small as a consequence. These are the class of white dwarfs. These objects represent old and very evolved stars that have shed their outer layers to reveal a very small but extremely hot inner core.

Hubble\: ellipticals \(E\)\, spirals \(S\)\, barred spirals \(SB\)\, and irregulars \(Ir\). Later on a separate class of lenticulars \(S0\) was appended as an intermediate type between ellipticals and spirals. The sequence starts with round elliptical galaxies \(E0\). Flatter galaxies are arranged following a number which is calculated from the ratio \(a - b\)/a\, where a and b are the major and minor axes as measured on the sky. Ellipticals are divided into eight categories \(E0\, E1\, ...\, E7\). Beyond E7 a clear disk is apparent in the lenticular \(S0\) galaxies. The sequence then splits into two parallel branches of disk galaxies showing spiral structure\: ordinary spirals\, S\, and barred spirals\, SB. The spiral and barred types are subdivided into Sa\, Sb\, Sc\, and SBa\, SBb\, SBc\, respectively. Along the sequence from Sa to Sc\, the central bulge becomes smaller\, while the spiral arms become more and more paramount. The original\, erroneous idea that such arrangement of the galaxies might represent an evolutionary sequence led to the ellipticals being referred to as early-type galaxies\, and the spirals and Irr I irregulars as late-type galaxies."

The deuterium nucleus then rapidly captures another proton to form a Helium-3 nucleus\, while emitting a gamma ray. There are three alternatives for the next step. In the proton-proton chain\, occurring in 86% of the cases\, two Helium-3 nuclei fuse to a final Helium-4 nucleus while two protons are released. The mass of the resulting Helium-4 nucleus is less than the total mass of the four original protons. The difference\, ~ 0.7% of the total mass of the protons\, is converted into energy and radiated by the Sun. In this process\, the Sun loses some 4 million tons of its mass each second." []

While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole \(SMBH\)\, other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes\: 1\) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2\) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3\) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions.

The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly\, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations\: the presence of high metallicity gas\, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters \(which suggests that gas stripping has occurred\). Alternatively\, the ICM is primordial\, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios." []

def: "A process based on the effects of opacity \(κ\) that drives the pulsations of many types of variable stars. Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer\, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward\, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer\, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families\, including Delta Scuti stars\, Beta Cephei variables\, Cepheids\, and RR Lyrae stars." []

Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long\, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system\, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus \(10^-18 m\). Still\, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger \(GW150914\) on September 14\, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists \(Rainer Weiss\, Barry C. Barish\, and Kip S.

The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy \(M31\) and the Milky Way\, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures\, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum \(M33\)\, which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses\, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group\, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound. Another remarkable member of the Group is IC 10." []

During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark\, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light\, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon.

Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth\, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds\, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C\, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly\, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface\, leaving only a thin shell." []

def: "In a star\, nebula\, or galaxy\, the proportion of the material that is made up of metals\, that is elements heavier than helium. It is generally denoted by Z.

In practice\, the metallicity of stars is usually expressed by the number ratio of iron atoms to hydrogen atoms per unit volume\, with respect to the solar values\: \[Fe/H\] = log10\(NFe/NH\)star - log10\(NFe/NH\)Sun\, where NFe and NH are the numbers of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit volume. In fact it is taken to be equal to the iron abundance with respect to the solar value. The solar logarithmic iron abundance is 7.50 ± 0.04\, with respect to that of hydrogen which\, by convention\, is 12.00. Stellar metallicity is often expressed in mass fraction.

As a comet orbits the Sun it sheds an icy\, dusty debris stream along its orbit. When the Earth's orbit intersects the dust trail\, more meteors are seen as the cometary debris encounters our planet's atmosphere. In the case of the Geminids and Quadrantids\, those meteor showers come from the debris scattered by orbiting asteroids. Typical meteor showers show 15 to 100 meteors per hour at their peak. On very rare occasions\, during a meteor storm\, thousands of meteors fall per hour.

def: "A streak of light caused when a meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere and becomes incandescent\, mostly from friction with the air at high speed. Meteors are also referred to as shooting stars. Very bright meteors are called fireball or bolide. Most of visible meteors arise from particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand\, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams. The brilliant flash of light from a meteor is mainly caused by the meteoroid's high level of kinetic energy as it collides with the atmosphere at high speeds \(11-72 km/s\). The increase in the number of meteors visible toward the end of the night results from the fact that the Earth rotates about its axis in the same direction as it orbits the Sun. This means that the leading edge \(morning side\) of the Earth encounters more meteoroids than the trailing edge \(evening side\). In general\, 2 to 3 times as many meteors can be seen in the hour or so just before morning twilight\, than can be seen in the early evening. Moreover\, the numbers of random\, or sporadic\, meteors vary from season to season\, due to the tilt of the Earth on its axis and other factors." []

def: "A spiral galaxy\, of which the solar system is a small part. It is the second largest in our Local Group of galaxies. The Milky Way is a disk-shaped system\, with a diameter of between 80\,000 and 100\,000 light-years and a thickness of about 2\,000 light-years\, containing more than 10^11 stars. The stars are divided into two main categories\, Population II stars and Population I stars. The core\, or nucleus\, of the Galaxy is surrounded by an ellipsoidal central bulge that measures some 15\,000 light-years in diameter and about 6\,000 light-years in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk. Surrounding the bulge and extending in a near spherical distribution above and below the Galactic plane is the Galactic halo. The halo contains about 200 globular clusters and an extremely thinly scattered population of individual stars. The Sun is located just over half way out from the center to the edge of the disk at a distance of about 25\,000 light-years. In common with other stars\, the Sun revolves around the Galactic Center. Its orbital velocity is about 220 km s^-1 and its orbital period is about 225 million years. Overall\, the Galaxy exhibits differential rotation\, that is stars and gas clouds closer to the center have shorter orbital periods than those that are located further out. The spiral arms of the Milky Way lie within its disk\, where bright young stars\, H II regions\, and molecular clouds of gas and dust are concentrated into curved 'arms' that appear to radiate from the central bulge in a spiral pattern. The Galaxy's spiral pattern consists of several major arms and a number of shorter segments\, one of which\, the Orion arm\, contains the Sun and the Orion star-forming region. Near-infrared observations have shown that the stars in the central bulge are arranged in an elongated galactic bar\, about twice as long as it is wide\, that is seen nearly end on from the present location of the solar system. The exact center\, or nucleus\, of the Galaxy coincides with a strong source of radio emission\, called Sagittarius A\, that is less than 15 astronomical units in diameter. Observations of the speeds at which clouds of ionized gas are revolving round the Galactic center imply that several million solar masses of material are concentrated within a region of about one light-year in radius. Since only about half of this mass can be accounted for by stars\, it seems likely that the balance \(about 2.5 million solar masses\) is contained in a central black hole and that accretion onto this black hole is the underlying source of the energy radiated by Sagittarius A. The Milky Way also has a dark matter component. The Galactic rotation curve indicates that there is a large amount of invisible non-baryonic surrounding the whole Galaxy." []

In other words\, a body can take a stable orbit around a black hole provided that it moves with the speed of light. However\, only photons can have such a velocity; hence the term 'photon sphere.' For a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole\, the photon sphere has a radius of R = 3GM/c2 = 3 RS/2\, where G is the gravitational constant\, M is the mass\, c is the speed of light\, and RS is the Schwarzschild radius. For a rotating\, Kerr black hole\, the situation is much more complex due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In that case circular paths exist for radii whose values depend on the rotation direction. More specifically\, in the equatorial plane there are two possible circular light paths\: a smaller one in the direction of the rotation\, and a larger one in the opposite direction." []

As a result\, these star forming clouds had a much higher temperature than in the present epoch\, and their Jeans mass was much higher. Therefore\, these first generation of stars were principally massive\, with a typical mass scale of order of about 100 M_sun. Population III stars started forming about 300 million years after the Big Bang at redshifts between 50 and 6\, when the Universe had between 1 and 5% of its present age. These stars were probably responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Given their high mass\, they lived only a few million years ending with either a pair-instability supernova phase or a direct collapse to a black hole. Population III stars thus initiated the chemical enrichment of the Universe and opened the way to more normal modes of star formation\, namely Population II.

Typically\, their sizes are ~100-500 AU\, masses ~10^-2 solar masses\, lifetimes ~10^6 - 10^7 years\, and accretion rates ~10^-7 - 10^-8 solar masses per year. According to the standard theory of planet formation\, called core accretion\, planets come into being by the growth of dust grains which stick together and produce ever larger bodies\, known as planetesimals. The agglomeration of these planetesimals of 100 to 1000 km in size into rocky Earth-mass planets is the main outcome of this theory. Beyond the snow line in the disk\, if the masses of these cores of rock and ice grow higher than 10 times that of Earth in less than a few million years\, gas can rapidly accrete and give rise to giant gaseous planets similar to Jupiter. If core building goes on too slowly\, the disk gas dissipates before the formation of giant planets can start. Finally the left-over planetesimals that could not agglomerate into rocky planets or core of giant planets remain as a debris disk around the central object that has become a main sequence star. An alternative to core accretion theory is formation of planets in a massive protoplanetary disk by gravitational instabilities. The validity of these two theories is presently debated. " []

As neutron stars concentrate an average of 1.4 solar masses on a diameter of only 20 km\, pulsars are exceedingly dense and compact\, representing the densest matter in the observable Universe. The pulsar radiation\, chiefly emitted in radio frequencies \(0.1-1 GHz\)\, is highly polarized. The exact mechanism by which a pulsar radiates is still a matter of vigorous investigation. Simply put\, an enormous electric field is induced by the rotation of a magnetized neutron star. The force of this field exceeds gravity by ten to twelve orders of magnitudes. Charged particles are whereby pulled out from the stellar surface resulting in a dense\, magnetized plasma that surrounds the pulsar \(magnetosphere\). The charged particles flow out of the magnetic polar caps of the neutron star\, following the open magnetic field lines. The acceleration of the charged particles along the curved magnetic field lines will cause them to radiate. " []

They are luminous because of their great size\, but have a relatively low surface temperature. All normal stars are expected to pass eventually through a red-giant phase as a consequence of stellar evolution. When a main sequence star has converted approximately 10% of its hydrogen to helium\, nuclear reactions in the core stop \(Schönberg-Chandrasekhar limit\). The hydrostatic equilibrium is no longer maintained\, and the core contracts while the outer layers expand and cool. This process produces the low surface temperature and large size \(from 10 to 100 times that of the Sun\) that characterize the red giant. In the core the temperature continues to rise. When it approaches 100\,000\,000 K helium will begin to fuse into carbon. Prominent bright red giants in the night sky include Aldebaran and Arcturus." []

Its average orbital speed being 9.69 km/s\, it takes Saturn 29.457 Earth years \(or 10\,759 Earth days\) to complete a single revolution around the Sun. However\, Saturn also takes just over 10 and a half hours \(10 hours 33 minutes\) to rotate once on its axis. This means that a single year on Saturn lasts about 24\,491 Saturnian solar days. Saturn has a mass of 5.6836 x 1026 kg \(95.159 Earth masses\) and a mean density of 0.687 g cm^\(-3\). Like Jupiter\, Saturn is about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium with traces of water\, methane\, and ammonia\, similar to the composition of the primordial Solar Nebula from which the solar system was formed. The temperature on Saturn is ~ -185 °C. Like Jupiter\, Saturn has a solid core of iron-nickel and rock \(silicon and oxygen compounds\). The core has an estimated mass of 9-22 Earth Masses and a diameter of about 25\,000 km \(about 2 Earth diameter\). The core is enveloped by a liquid metallic hydrogen layer and a molecular hydrogen layer. Saturn's interior is hot \(12\,000 K at the core\). The planet radiates more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Most of the extra energy is generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism as in Jupiter. Saturn has 62 known satellites.

Thickness of crust ~ 60 km; of mantle ~ 1000 km. Temperature of core ~ 1500 K. It would have taken only 107 years to slow the Moon's rotation into its present lock with its orbital period. Because of this synchronous rotation\, the Moon revolves once on its axis each time it orbits the Earth\, thus always presenting the same face\, the nearside\, toward Earth.

The theorem states that the radiative flux is proportional to the local effective gravity at the considered colatitude\, F\(θ\) ∝ g_eff \(θ\)α\, where α is the gravity darkening coefficient. As a consequence\, the stellar surface will not be uniformly bright\, because there is a much larger flux and a higher effective temperature at the pole than at the equator \(T_eff \(θ\) ∝ g_eff \(θ\)β\, where β is the gravity darkening exponent.

They are composed of a core of carbon and oxygen nuclei and degenerate electrons surrounded by a thin shell of helium and an outer skin of hydrogen. White dwarf's radiation is the leftover heat from the star's past when its core was an active nuclear reactor. The star slowly cools as heat escapes through the non-degenerate envelope. The first white dwarf to be discovered was Sirius B\, the companion of Sirius.

def: "A phenomenon observed in a cluster of galaxies\, whereby the cluster core loses energy via X-ray radiation because of the collisions between the gas particles. The radiation rate is proportional to the square of the density\, and the cooling time\, which remains in the outer parts too large\, becomes smaller than the Hubble time in the core. As a result\, the central regions of clusters of galaxies cool down; and since in the center of a cluster gas pressure and gravitational attraction are in equilibrium\, the gas density has to rise to maintain the pressure necessary for supporting the outer layers of gas. To cause its density to rise\, the cooled gas has to flow inward. As the densest gas\, which cools quickest\, is already concentrated in the center of the cluster\, the inward flow will start at the center\, soon followed by the outer layers. This flow of gas is called the cooling flow. Cooling flows are moderated through feedback due to the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of the central galaxy. The gas inflow to the center fuels the active galactic nucleus \(AGN\). The latter then heats again the gas through its radio jets." []

The star's effective temperature on the HB is higher than it was on the RGB\, but the luminosity is considerably less than at the helium flash. Usually HB stars have two energy sources\: in addition to the helium burning in their cores\, they experience hydrogen fusion in a surrounding shell. The thickness of the shell determines the color of the HB stars. A thin shell\, involving low opacity\, makes the star look blue.

def: "A plot showing the energy emitted by a source as a function of the radiation wavelength or frequency. It is used in many branches of astronomy to characterize astronomical sources\, in particular mainly in near infrared and middle infrared to study protostars or young stellar objects. The SED of these objects is divided in four classes. Class 0 in which the SED represents a very embedded protostar\, where the mass of the central core is small in comparison to the mass of the accreting envelope. The SED is characterized by the blackbody radiation of the envelope and peaks at submillimeter wavelengths. Class I objects possess a SED that peaks in the far infrared and is characterized by a weak contribution of the blackbody of the central protostar \(detected in near infrared\) and the emission of a thick disk and dense envelope. These objects have less mass in the envelope and more massive central cores with respect to Class 0. Class II objects are the classical T Tauri stars with a SED due to the emission of a thin disk and the central star. They have accumulated most of their final mass and have dispersed almost completely their circumstellar envelope. Finally\, Class III objects have pure photospheric spectra. Their SED is peaked in the optical and is well approximated by a blackbody emission with a faint infrared excess due to the presence of a residual optically thin disk that may be the origin of planetesimals. This classification scheme can be made more quantitative by defining a spectral index." []

In 1705 Edmond Halley used Newton's new theory of gravitation to determine the orbits of comets from their recorded positions in the sky as a function of time. He found that the bright comets of 1531\, 1607\, and 1682 had almost the same orbits. He concluded that these appearances must belong to a single recurring comet\, and predicted its return for 1758.

It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere. Its surface temperature is -179 °C\, which makes water as hard as rocks and allows methane to be found in its liquid form. Its surface pressure is slightly higher than Earth's pressure \(1.6 bars against 1 bar at sea level\). The Huygens probe released from Cassini-Huygens landed on Titan on December 25\, 2004. From the data obtained by Cassini-Huygens\, we know that Titan is a world with lakes and seas composed of liquid methane and ethane near its poles\, with vast\, arid regions not made of silicates as on Earth\, but of solid water ice coated with hydrocarbons that fall from the atmosphere. Titan's icy dunes are gigantic\, reaching\, on average\, 1 to 2 km wide\, hundreds kilometers long and around 100 m high. Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids flowing across its surface as the planet cycles through its seasons. Each Titan season lasts about 7.5 Earth years. The Huygens probe made the first direct measurements of Titan's lower atmosphere. Huygens also directly sampled aerosols in the atmosphere and confirmed that carbon and nitrogen are their major constituents. Cassini followed up Huygens' measurements from orbit\, detecting other chemicals that include propylene and poisonous hydrogen cyanide\, in Titan's atmosphere. Cassini's gravity measurements of Titan revealed that this moon is hiding an internal\, liquid water and ammonia ocean beneath its surface. Huygens also measured radio signals during its descent that strongly suggested the presence of an ocean 55 to 80 km below the moon's surface." []

Triton is colder than any other measured object in the solar system with a surface temperature of -235° C. It has an extremely thin atmosphere. Nitrogen ice particles might form thin clouds a few kilometers above the surface. The atmospheric pressure at Triton's surface is about 15 microbars\, 0.000015 times the sea-level surface pressure on Earth.

Its orbital period is 3.55 Earth days which equals its rotation period. Europa's density is 3.0 g cm^-3\, typical of a mixture of rocks including ice. Its high albedo \(0.67\) suggests that its surface is mostly water ice. The surface temperature of Europa ranges between about 125 K \(-150 °C\) at the equator and about 50 K \(-220 °C\) at the poles. There are few impact craters on Europa\, because its surface is too active and therefore young. The most striking features of Europa's surface are structures called lineae and lenticulae. The thickness of the ice crust could range between a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers. It is now believed that there is an ocean of salty water\, up to 100 km deep\, flowing under Europa's ice. Europa's ocean is kept liquid due to tidal heating by Jupiter." []

Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior\, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out. Some of Io's volcanic lava is so hot it glows in the dark." []
